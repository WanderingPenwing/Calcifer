# Calcifer

My custom code editor (only the features I want inside) using egui and a fork of egui_code_editor https://lib.rs/crates/egui_code_editor  
  
# GUI
using egui to have immediate mod rendering (so the app is using very few processing power when not interacted with)  


# Screeshots

# Features
- find and replace
- undo/redo
- syntax highlighting (asm, js, lua, py, rust, shell, sql)
- simple themes
- tabs
- file tree  
- terminal
- a very crude project mode (kanban)
